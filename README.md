### Hello. 🦐👍

I'm a pretty novice programmer who wants to get a computer science degree and become a software engineer.
But I'm not very good! I'm a junior in high school who has already taken AP CSP and is currently taking AP CSA.
I have most of the unit projects for AP CSA on code.org posted, so if you want good grades, you can copy them.
I don't care.
